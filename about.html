    <a style="color: rgb(235, 235, 235); font-size: 16px;">Multistream Tools, created by SeenWonderAlex, are tools that
        can help you handle streaming in multiple platforms such as Twitch and YouTube. These are intended to assist you
        into handling multiple chats, without manually running the other. Not many tools are provided, but more are
        expected to develop in the near future!</a>

    <p>Combined Twitch & YouTube Polls is a tool to help combine results from multiple platforms at once. No need to
        do math anymore. This is for you to simply create a poll and see all the votes at once.</p>
    <p>This tool also offers the ability to save and load Poll presets, in order to run polls quicker and easier.
        It's a time saver for running and getting feedback, without changing the user's end.
    </p>
    <a style="color: rgb(166, 42, 42);">Requires either a Twitch or a YouTube account that has access to live
        streaming. This tool does not require
        you
        to connect both accounts in order to run polls on one platform.

    <a>NOTICE: When left-clicking on the "Connect" button on Twitch, we'll ask you to
        authenticate Twitch for our other tool as well. If you are planning to only use this tool, please right
        click
        the button instead.</a>
    <br>
    <a style="color: red;">For YouTube, we'll only ask you to "Manage your YouTube Account" in order to retrieve
        broadcasts and run polls.</a>
